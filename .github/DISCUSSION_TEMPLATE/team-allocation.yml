        We want teams to be ready to go on the day, that's why we now pre-allocate the teams. Here are the team allocations.
        Stakeholders â€“ People you should have corridor conversations with prior to as well as throughout the day. They would also be a good choice for your PowerPoint Test Please.
        Test Pleases at 2pm â€“ so you have enough time to go through the entire presentation and then action the feedback.
        If a stakeholder is not available, grab any person (who isn't on your team)!
        Let me know if there are any concerns ðŸ˜Š
        Review your team idea and prepare for the day.
