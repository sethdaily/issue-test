    "Hi All, |
    " We want teams to be ready to go on the day, that's why we now pre-allocate the teams. Here are the team allocations.

    " Stakeholders ‚Äì People you should have corridor conversations with prior to as well as throughout the day. They would also be a good choice for your PowerPoint Test Please.

    " Test Pleases at 2pm ‚Äì so you have enough time to go through the entire presentation and then action the feedback.

    " If a stakeholder is not available, grab any person (who isn't on your team)!
    " Let me know if there are any concerns üòä

Review your team idea and prepare for the day."
